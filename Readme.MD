# Flower Classification with Various Deep Learning Models

This project demonstrates the classification of flower images using several pre-trained deep learning models. The models used in this project include ResNet-50, VGG, InceptionV3, MobileNet, and Fine-tuning techniques for each model.

## Files Overview

### 1. `RESNET_50_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION_(1).ipynb`
This Jupyter notebook implements flower classification using the ResNet-50 model. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

### 2. `VGG_FLOWER.ipynb`
This notebook uses the VGG model for flower classification. It covers the process of loading the VGG model, fine-tuning it for flower classification, and evaluating the results.

### 3. `inception_FLOWER_CLASSIFICATION.ipynb`
This notebook implements flower classification using the InceptionV3 model. It also includes model training and evaluation steps.

### 4. `mobilenet_finetuning.ipynb`
In this notebook, MobileNet is fine-tuned for flower classification. It shows how to adjust the MobileNet model for specific use cases and improve accuracy.

### 5. `tqdm_inceptionv3_recognition.ipynb`
This notebook uses InceptionV3 for flower image recognition with progress bars using the `tqdm` library to track the training process.
